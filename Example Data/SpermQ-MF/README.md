# Example data sets for SpermQ-MF
Here, we provide a [data set to run SpermQ-MF in the test calibration mode on a multifocal, piezo-driven z-stack through a non-moving sperm](https://github.com/hansenjn/MultifocalImaging-AnalysisToolbox/tree/master/Example%20Data/SpermQ-MF/Verify%20LUT) and a [data set to run SpermQ-MF on multifocal images from a freely-swimming human sperm](https://github.com/hansenjn/MultifocalImaging-AnalysisToolbox/tree/master/Example%20Data/SpermQ-MF/Reconstruct%20Beat). Because multifocal data sets are generally big in size, we selected only 250 time frames (0.5 sec) of the frerly-swimming human sperm cell as an example data set. Please see also the [User Guide](https://github.com/hansenjn/MultifocalImaging-AnalysisToolbox/tree/master/User%20Guide) for detailed explanations on SpermQ-MF settings.
