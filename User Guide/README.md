# Multifocal Image Analysis â€“ User Guide
The [User Guide PDF file](https://github.com/hansenjn/MultifocalImaging-AnalysisToolbox/blob/master/User%20Guide/MultifocalImageAnalysis-UserGuide.pdf)
describes the workflow for tracking beads and reconstructing filaments in multifocal images using ImageJ and the tools published in
the MultifocalImaging-AnalysisToolbox. See [here](https://github.com/hansenjn/MultifocalImaging-AnalysisToolbox/blob/master/README.md)
for system requirements, an installation guide, license information, and credits.

Note: Since May 13, 2021 we provide a new version of the user guide, because a new version of [MultiFocalParticleTracker-Complex-3](https://github.com/hansenjn/MultiFocalParticleTracker-Complex-3/releases) was released. The new version implements a more precise algorithm for inferring the z-position.
