## 1. Estimating x,y, and z precision from statistics of bead displacement
The following programs calculate the tracks of beads based on a text file generated by the ImageJ plugin [MultiFocalParticleTracker-Complex-3](https://github.com/hansenjn/MultiFocalParticleTracker-Complex-3). Execute “TracksBuilder.m” to calculate the tracks of individual beads from the text files. The program will generate a Tracks.mat file containing the positions of beads in time and will generate an overview plot of the bead tracks:

</p>

After this, run the software “StatisticsBeads.mlx”. This program computes the precision of the multifocal method from the mean squared displacement of the beads and their theoretical diffusion coefficient.
